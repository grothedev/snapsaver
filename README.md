snapsaver
=========

an android app that saves snapchats

How it Works: When the app starts, there is a button to press. This button will copy the pictures and videos onto your sdcard(from /data/data/com.snapchat.android/cache/received_image_snaps/ and /storage/sdcard0/Android/data/com.snapchat.android/cache/received_video_snaps/ to /storage/sdcard0/savedsnaps) then decrypt the files.
